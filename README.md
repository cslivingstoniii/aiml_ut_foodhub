# FoodHub Data Analysis  
**Exploratory Data Analysis | Python | Business Intelligence | Data Storytelling**

## Project Overview  
This project showcases a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **FoodHub** dataset, simulating a real-world business case for an online food delivery platform operating in New York City. The notebook was completed as part of a Python Foundations course within an AI/ML curriculum and emphasizes both technical proficiency and business insight generation.

## Business Objective  
As a data analyst at FoodHub, your task is to uncover customer behavior, restaurant performance, and delivery patterns to guide business decisions that improve operations, user satisfaction, and strategic growth.

## Tech Stack  
The analysis is conducted in **Python**, using the following libraries:

- `pandas` â€“ data manipulation  
- `numpy` â€“ numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` â€“ data visualization  

Files included:
- `FoodHub_Project.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook version)
- `FoodHub_Project.html` (rendered notebook)
- `foodhub_orders.csv` (dataset)

## Key Insights

1. **Top Restaurants Identified:**  
   Restaurant ID 135043 recorded the highest number of orders, while 149824 showed the highest average rating, suggesting a strong quality-driven customer segment.

2. **Ratings vs. Delivery Time:**  
   A weak correlation exists between average delivery time and customer ratings, indicating that factors other than speed influence customer satisfaction.

3. **Improvement Opportunities:**  
   Low-rated restaurants with high delivery times may benefit from operational enhancements or partnership review.

## Sample Visualizations  
*Note: These are automatically generated from the notebook.*

- Bar plots of order counts per restaurant  
- Histograms of delivery times  
- Scatter plots of rating vs delivery time  
- Correlation heatmaps  

## Getting Started

To reproduce the analysis locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FoodHub-EDA.git
cd FoodHub-EDA

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Launch the notebook
jupyter notebook FoodHub_Project.ipynb
```
